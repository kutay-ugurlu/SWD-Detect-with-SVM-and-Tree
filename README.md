# SWD-Detect-with-SVM

## Repo Description 
A 12 feature SVM implementation of SWD Detection algorithm implemented in MATLAB R2021b. 
Impmlemented for performance comparison to Neural Network architecture in [SWD-Detection-in-Rats](https://github.com/kutay-ugurlu/SWD-Detection-in-Rats/edit/master/README.md)

## Data 
The directories in [MAT and absz](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vaUe2F92PrSW9aJ2wb3HlJAm2VHjDsR9?usp=sharing) should be downloaded to the directory to parse the data and create feature matrices.
